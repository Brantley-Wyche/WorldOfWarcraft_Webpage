# WorldOfWarcraft_Webpage
Webpage that pulls data from the World of Warcraft API


Extra technologies used
* Sass
* MDBootstrap
* jQuery

APIs called (all were in the Community APIs):
* Items in the Character Profile API section (for item data)
* Stats in the Character Profile API section (for character stats)
* Item in the Item API section (for the buy/sell prices and the required level)

Comments:
* I wanted to make the design as close as possible to the example so I proceeded to do the following:
* I used the logo and background image that were in the Test-API.psd file for this project.  
* I merged all of the background layers into one and then used that as the background for the website.  
* I sampled the colors that were used for the containers and text.
* I also used the close button image and made it into a fully functional button. 

I got EVERYTHING from the Items API call (as requested in the instructions)

I completed the bonus step and got the buy and sell prices for the returned items as well as the required level.  
I included this data in a modal that can be accessed via the 'Bonus Item Stats' button in the left container.

I have made this website as responsive as I could.

I have included the original CSS stylesheet that I was using before I converted to using the stylesheet that was compiled from SCSS.  
This is for your reference and You can also use this file in place of the new one if you change the path in the link tag in index.html.
